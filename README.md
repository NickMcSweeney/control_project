# Control Project
### 2 "finger" gripper

#### Goal:
+ grip
+ lift
+ perform realistically

#### Minimum
+ At least 1 use case (object) can be lifted.
+ PID based controller implemented.
+ Test performance with different objects
+ Test alternate controllers

#### Extensions
+ Higher level controller - MPC
+ Variable objects
+ Mass detection

## Gripper Control
> grasp an object between fingers and exert only the force requred to overcome slippage.

## Lift Control
> move an object to a set height and back to ground without overshoot.
